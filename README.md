Up to now following datasets are needed: 

* Lc-Quad train_data & test_data\
[Download](https://github.com/AskNowQA/LC-QuAD)

* pre-trained embedding using FastText & GloVe\
These datasets would be stored in five files in total, which will be downloaded in the first run. There is no need to download it manually.

Embedding.py: pre-trained word embedding of FastText and GloVe, which will be downloaded when first run\
paths.py : lc-quad train data. This file will maintain all useful datasets except pre-trained embeddings
